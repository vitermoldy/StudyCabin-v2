  taste-skill motion.js - the moving half of the micro-interaction layer (motion.css is the rest).
  Load it once, after system.js (motion.css needs no attribute; <html data-motion="off"> turns the layer off, JS too):
    <script type="module" src="assets/motion/motion.js"></script>
  It starts by itself. references/motion.md says what moves and how fast.

  - the hero's entrance: .hero[data-enter] enters once on load (the h1 line by line, then the lead,
    the buttons and the facts, the picture settling), about 1.1 s, when the head line set html.m-enter
    before the first paint:
    <script>document.documentElement.classList.add('m-enter');setTimeout(()=>document.documentElement.classList.add('m-enter-done'),700)</script>

  - nav: .m-menu-open from the moment a menu starts to show (150ms of intent), so the next word swaps the panel at once
    instead of waiting 150ms again; it stays while the pointer is on the word or its panel.
  - tabs: every .tabs[role=tablist] gets one indicator that slides to the selected tab (system.js
    still selects; this follows aria-selected).
  - numbers: [data-m-count] on a stat ticks from 0 to its own text once, when 60% of it is on
